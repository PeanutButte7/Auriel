**For security reasons a file with token for the bot is not included. To add it simply create a file named `config.json` in the root directory and add your token. Also specify the id for your testing channel and if bot is in production or not. If it's not it will react only to messages sent to your testing channel.**
```
{
  "token": "your_token_here",
   "in_production": true,
   "testing_channel_id": "your_testing_channel_id_here"
}
```
